## Project Goals  🎯 
- Deepen understanding of hardware emulation, computer architecture, and CPU design  
- Implement the Ricoh 6502 CPU with full cycle accuracy and complete instruction set coverage  
- Study and recreate the NES PPU, including accurate background and sprite rendering  
- Support multiple cartridge mappers to correctly handle ROM banking and memory layout  
- Implement accurate memory operations, including NES memory mirroring  
- Build a working emulator capable of running classic NES games reliably
